# Psychic-Game

The user will choose any letter and has 9 chances to guess the same letter the computer has randomly generated.
When the user's guess and the computer's guess match, a win is added and new game starts.
If the number of chances runs out and the guesses never match, a loss is added. A new game will start.
The user can play till they are either convinced they are psychic or convinced they are not.
